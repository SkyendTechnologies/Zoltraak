## üöÄ Overview

**Zoltraak** is a cutting-edge blockchain project built on the **TON (The Open Network)** ecosystem. It combines decentralized storage, advanced encryption powered by **AetherShield**, and a tokenized economy to enable secure, private, and efficient file sharing and storage solutions.

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Features

- **Decentralized File Sharing**  
  Share files securely across the TON network with end-to-end encryption. Every transaction is governed by transparent smart contracts.

- **Tokenized Ecosystem**  
  Utilize **Zoltraak Tokens (ZOL)** for file encryption, sharing, and storage payments. Rewards are distributed to storage nodes for ensuring data integrity.

- **AetherShield Encryption**  
  Advanced multi-layered encryption ensures that all files remain protected during transfer and storage.

- **Scalable and Efficient**  
  Powered by the TON blockchain, Zoltraak is fast, reliable, and scalable for personal and enterprise-level applications.

## üìñ How It Works

1. **Upload a File**  
   Users upload files, which are automatically encrypted using **AetherShield** and fragmented into smaller chunks.

2. **Distributed Storage**  
   The encrypted chunks are stored across the TON network nodes, ensuring fault tolerance and decentralization.

3. **Smart Contract Management**  
   File access is managed via smart contracts, ensuring only authorized users can retrieve and decrypt the data.

4. **Token Economy**
   - Users pay in ZOL tokens for file sharing and storage services.
   - Storage nodes earn ZOL tokens by maintaining file fragments and ensuring uptime.

5. **File Retrieval**  
   Authorized users can retrieve the file by paying ZOL tokens and decrypt it using the provided keys.
