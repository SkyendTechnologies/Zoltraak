## Overview

**Zoltraak** is a decentralized blockchain platform built upon the foundation of the **TON (The Open Network)** blockchain. This project leverages the robust, scalable, and secure infrastructure of TON to offer a flexible platform for creating and managing digital assets, decentralized applications (dApps), and custom tokens.

Zoltraak is designed to bring transparency, security, and efficiency to blockchain-based transactions while maintaining compliance with the principles of open-source development.
